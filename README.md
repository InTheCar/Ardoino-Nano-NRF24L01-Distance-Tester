# Ardoino-Nano-NRF24L01-Distance-Tester
## The principle
The aim of this project is to test the connection between
two points. The transmitter will have a counter starting with 1.
The echo will receive the counter value and sends it back to the transmitter.
 The transmitter will receive the counter value which was sent before
 and increment the counter. The new counter value will be used for the next round.
